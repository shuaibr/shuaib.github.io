            <h3>Do you command people to virtuous conduct, and forget yourselves, even though you read the Scripture? Do you not understand? And seek help through patience and prayer. But it is difficult, except for the devout. Those who know that they will meet their Lord, and that to Him they will return. (2:44-46)</h3>

            <h2>Duaas</h2>
            <h3>• Oh Allah grant me wisdom to know when to speak and when to be silent. 
                Oh Allah grant me the wisdom to separate between false and truth, fact and opinion.
                • Oh Allah don’t make my love of you based on my mood, age, status, health but increasingly strong, and eternal regardless.
                • Oh Allah grant me the remorse of Adam, the certainty of Ibrahim, the forgiveness of Yusuf, the patience of Ayub, the remembrance of Yunis, the tenderness of Issa and the comprehensiveness of Muhammad, peace be upon them all.
                • Oh Allah give me the wisdom to know when to accept and when to reject, when to forgive and when to punish, when to give and when to deny, and when to speak and when to be silent. 
                • Oh Allah grant me Knowledge, understanding, creativity, experience, skills, intelligence, intuition, inspiration, sincerity, humbleness, the ability to adapt and grant me wisdom.
                • Oh Allah grant me the wisdom to distinguish between a social tradition I should respect and another I must strive to improve.
                • Oh Allah protect me from praises that spoil and corrupt and forgive what praisers don't know about me. 
                • Oh Allah I ask you not to weaken my memory when old, lest I forget all the great things you taught me.
                • Oh Allah I live in an age where the focus is on the individual, and I belong to a heritage, which  focuses on the community. Oh Allah grant me the wisdom to balance between the two. 
                • Oh Allah make me not judge others, for you are the judge of all people. 
                • Oh Allah immerse me in the river of your wisdom.
                • Oh Allah grant me the ability to read faster, yet with deep reflection, and know the details yet comprehend the bigger picture.
                • Oh Allah grant me the ability to simplify the complex, comprehend the difficult, remember the good and forget pains and agonies. 
                • Oh Allah strengthen my memory, my mind to understand, my heart to love, my body to worship, my will to improve, and my deeds to forgive my sins. 
                • Oh Allah grant me the ability to live my time while being ahead of it, adapt to my world while reforming it, cherish my history while learning from its pitfalls. </h3>
